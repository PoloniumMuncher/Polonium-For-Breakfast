		<i>Chapter 1</i>
		<br/><br/>
		Few beings are as pathetic as minor gods. Sure, they're
		still ageless, nigh immortal beings of light and holiness, but that doesn't
		mean they know what they're doing. They certainly aren't any more qualified to
		handle the massive dick measuring contest of godhood than the average Joe. At
		least your typical fast food worker doesn't have to worry if they're flipping
		burgers with enough flair to look dignified. Major gods have choirs of angels,
		temples all across the globe, countless priests and followers. They give their
		representatives extraordinary abilities, they bless their most devout with
		health and wealth. The only riches a minor god can shower their followers with
		is the change they found between the couch cushions. They get barely any
		worship and give just as little in return.<br/>
		<br/>
		I honestly don't mind, though. I'm a devout follower of all the gods too
		pathetic to have their own religion. I don't have to get anything out of it.
		I'm a holy superhero, and superheroes help those in need. We're supposed to
		protect the weak, not &quot;protect the weak unless they happen to come from a
		divine household&quot; or whatever it is people actually expect from us. Sometimes
		it feels like I'm the only one who got the memo, though. While others hunt down
		drug dealers or stop terrorist attacks for freedom and love, I subdue
		pickpockets in the name of Beevra, the Bucktoothed Goddess. She deserves some
		recognition, dammit!<br/>
		<br/>
		I do this every day and every night, whenever I can. If I'm busy, I still make
		the time. Crime doesn't wait for when it's convenient to fight it, and
		someone's got to protect the community. If not me, then who? The police?
		Please. They're worse than useless. More of a hindrance than anything, really. Soft
		on actual criminals, tough on people trying to help. They don't really get it. You've
		got to break a few noses to make a nose omelette. And today... Today I'm making
		one hell of a nose omelette.<br/>
		<br/>
		I turn off my computer and take a moment to admire my shitty flat. I can afford
		much better, but it just wouldn't feel right not to live in a horrible mess.
		It's hard to feel tough when your floor isn't practically falling apart and
		your light is anything other than a single lightbulb hanging from a cable. Besides,
		the weird mould in the corner grows on you over time... Literally. I take care
		not to touch it, I know what happened to the poor sod who lived here before. I
		sometimes still hear quiet sobs coming from the walls. I'll have to deal with
		that some day.<br/>
		<br/>
		Not today, though. Today I've got more important things to worry about. I put
		on my excuse for a costume I've been using for the last few years: A trench coat
		and a fedora. I dyed them white, but it didn't work that great, so there are
		still patches of beige in places. I also added golden lines as decoration and a
		star at the front of the fedora, all of which I quite literally painted on. I
		know it's terrible, but what was I supposed to do? Keep ruining clothes until I
		got a decent costume out of it? No! This is fine. It works. At least I hope it
		does.<br/>
		<br/>
		I look at what little I can make out of my reflection in the cracked, dirty
		mirror. There are two common looks for this kind of costume: a neckbeard and a
		hard-boiled detective or gangster. Sadly, I don't belong in either of those
		categories. As much as I hope to see Humphrey Bogart whenever I look in the
		mirror, the face that looks back is always that of a tired man whose only decent
		looking feature is his lush, chestnut coloured lampshade moustache. Always
		waxed for the glory of Nabbryr, God of Hair (Facial or Otherwise), of course. A
		mirrored photo of my face with minor tweaks and a moustache hole serve as my
		mask. It's different enough to work, and most people aren't that perceptive,
		anyway. All in all, it's a tolerable costume... Maybe... Eeeeeeh...<br/>
		<br/>
		No. This doesn't look right. Any other day, it would be perfectly serviceable,
		but I need something different today. Something less conspicuous. I don't
		really have the kind of getup I need today, but I suppose I can buy something
		with the savings from not living in a decent flat. I'll find a way to look nice
		and villainy later. I take my costume off. I won't be using it today.<br/>
		<br/>
		For now, I just get my equipment from under the loose floorboards. A stun baton
		with an inbuilt torch - an invaluable multitool in this line of work. A length
		of rope. Some money, just in case. A pack of tissues. And, of course, a fancy
		bronze pistol. It's a fairly unique weapon made for some oil baron quite a
		while ago, or so the guy who sold me the thing said. I like how recognisable it
		is. I can be &quot;that guy with the bronze pistol.&quot; As far as signature
		weapons go, I could do a whole lot worse.<br/>
		<br/>
		Aaaand with all my stuff ready, I'm faced with another problem. Because of
		course I am. Without my trench coat, I don't have the ungodly amount of pocket
		space needed for all this stuff. I look around for something to put it in, but
		nothing I have here is really all that useful. I shouldn't have thrown away the
		grocery bags. Hm. Bags. Thrown away. A-ha! I've still got some empty bin bags.
		I put everything in one and I'm on my way.<br/>
		<br/>
		First, I go to Eccentric Bob's Overly Specific Everything Shop. It's the best
		place if you want to look like a weird C-list villain. I get myself a black
		cape with the faces of a local cricket team, which I put on the wrong way round
		so it just looks black. I pair it with an acid spitting bowler hat and a
		utility belt to put my things in. I get a glittery domino mask to hide my face.
		To top it all off, I get a pack of self-lighting, completely black cigarettes.
		Pretty sure they're covered in tar. With the preparations done, I proceed
		towards my destination: The Bad Neighbourhood. <br/>
		<br/>
		Like many other masked vigilantes, I don't really have superpowers. Quite
		unlike the other costumed daredevils, however, I'm also not rich enough for
		fancy gadgets, I'm not a ninja or ex special forces, and I most definitely
		wasn't raised by mutant swans. About the only thing I can do is call upon the
		collective power of the gods to make my moustache shimmer in the moonlight, and
		I don't think that's enough to scare Murders McMurdoch and the Greased Palms
		Brigade. You need a death wish or a healthy diet of crayons to go after the big
		fish without knowing you can hit hard. Since I'm not one of the folks who can
		take down crime syndicates all on their own, I need to be slow and methodic.
		That's why I've been taking it slowly, dealing with small fries first. I hope
		to work my way up to the big leagues, become the protector of Ipswich, its
		guardian angel. Except there's one problem: I can't do much alone, but I also
		can't get the support I need without being noticed. In order to get this ball
		rolling, I need to do something really fucking risky and incredibly stupid. So
		that's what I'm about to do. <br/>
		<br/>
		I'm at the edge of The Bad Neighbourhood now. It's so easy to tell where it
		begins: All the buildings are damaged, everything's tagged, and there's a line
		of blood marking the border. It's still not the most dangerous place in the
		world, far from it. I had a mate who went to Glasgow once. Indian guy, hadn't
		been to England yet at that point. It probably saved his life. The fuckers
		there can smell anything English from a mile away. He was barely three hours
		there and I'm still surprised he survived. He ran into a razor gang. They call
		them that, but many had knives and claymores. I guess it rolls off the tongue
		easier than &quot;miscellaneous weapon gang.&quot; He looked at them all
		weirded out cause he thought they were snorting coke in public, though from
		what I've heard about those people it was probably capsaicin or anthrax. Poor
		guy ran all the way to England before he lost them. Traumatised him quite a
		bit. So many nightmares. He heard them chanting &quot;Chib the wanker&quot;
		every night for the rest of his life. In the end, he got eaten by the mould,
		rest his soul.<br/>
		<br/>
		Whatever is in The Bad Neighbourhood, it can't be worse than that. If people can
		succeed there, I can make a name for myself here. All of Ipswich will know who
		Dawnbringer is. <br/>
		<br/>
		I take a deep breath and step into my destiny.<br/>

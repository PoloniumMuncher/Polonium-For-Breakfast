		<h2>Rise of Dawnbringer</h2>
		
		<i>Chapter 1</i>
		<br/><br/>
		Few beings are quite as pathetic as minor gods Sure, they're
		still ageless, nigh immortal being of light and holiness, but that doesn't mean
		they know what they're doing. They certainly aren't any more qualified to
		handle the massive dick measuring contest of godhood than the average Joe. At
		least your typical fast food worker doesn't have to worry if they're flipping
		burgers with enough flair to look dignified. Major gods have choirs of angels,
		temples all across the globe, countless priests and followers. They give their
		representatives extraordinary abilities, they bless their most devout with
		health and wealth. The only riches a minor god can shower their followers with
		is the change they found between the couch cushion. They get barely any worship
		and give just as little in return.<br>
		<br>
		I honestly don't mind, though. I'm a devout follower of all the gods too
		pathetic to have their own religion. I don't have to get anything out of it.
		I'm a holy superhero, and that's what superheroes do. We're supposed to protect
		the weak, not &quot;protect the weak unless they happen to come from a divine
		household&quot; or whatever it is people actually expect from us. I'm the only
		one who got the memo, though. While others hunt down drug dealers or stop
		terrorist attacks for freedom and love, I subdue pickpockets in the name of Beevra,
		the Bucktoothed Goddess. He deserves some recognition, dammit!<br>
		<br>
		I do this every day and every night, whenever I can. If I'm busy, I still make
		the time. Crime doesn't wait for when it's convenient to fight it, and
		someone's got to protect the community. If not me, then who? The police?
		Please. They're worse than useless. More of a hindrance than anything, really. Soft
		on actual criminals, tough on people trying to help. They don't get it. You've
		got to break a few noses to make a nose omelette. <br>
		<br>
		And today... Today I'm making one hell of a nose omelette. This will be much
		more dangerous than my regular patrol. I turn off my computer and take a moment
		to admire my shitty flat. I can afford much better, but it just wouldn't feel
		right not to live in a horrible mess. It's hard to feel tough when your floor
		isn't practically falling apart, and the weird mould in the corner grows on you
		over time... Literally. I take care not to touch it, I know what happened to
		the poor sod who lived here before. I sometimes still hear quiet sobs coming
		from the walls. I'll have to deal with that some day.<br>
		<br>
		Not today, though. I put on my excuse for a costume I made a few years: A trench
		coat and a fedora. I dyed them white, but it didn't work that great, so there
		are still patches of beige in places. I also added golden lines as decoration
		and a star at the front of the fedora, all of which I quite literally painted
		on. I know it's terrible, but what was I supposed to do? Keep ruining clothes
		until I got a decent costume out of it? This is fine. It works. At least I hope
		so.<br>
		<br>
		I look at what little I can make out of my reflection in the cracked, dirty
		mirror. There are two common looks for this kind of costume: a neckbeard and a
		hard-boiled detective/gangster. Sadly, I don't belong in either of those
		categories. As much as I hope to see Humphrey Bogart whenever I look in the
		mirror, the face that looks back is that of a middle-aged man whose only good
		looking feature is a lush, chestnut coloured lampshade moustache. Always waxed
		for the glory of Nabbryr, God of Hair (Facial or Otherwise) of course. A
		mirrored photo of my face with minor tweaks and a moustache hole serve as my
		mask. Most people aren't perceptive enough to recognise me when they see me in
		public without it. All in all, it's a tolerable costume... Maybe... Eeeeeeh...<br>
		<br>
		No. This doesn't look right. Any other day, it would be perfectly serviceable,
		but I need something different today. Something less conspicuous. I don't
		really have the kind of getup I need today, but I suppose I can buy something
		with the money I've saved by not living in a decent flat. I'll find a way to
		look nice and villainy later. I take off my costume, mask excluded.<br>
		<br>
		For now, I get my equipment from under the loose floorboards. A stun baton with
		an inbuilt torch - an invaluable multitool in this line of work. A length of
		rope. Some money, just in case. A pack of tissues. And, of course, a fancy
		bronze pistol. It's a fairly unique weapon made for some oil baron quite a
		while ago, or so the guy selling it to me told me. I like how recognisable it
		is. I can be &quot;that guy with the bronze pistol.&quot; It's a nice signature
		weapon, though I don't usually have to use it, and I think it pleases the gods.
		It sure pleases me.<br>
		<br>
		Aaaand now I'm faced with another problem. Because of course I am. Without my
		trench coat, I don't have the ungodly amount of pocket space needed for all
		this stuff. I look around for something to put it in, but nothing I have here
		is really all that useful. I shouldn't have thrown away the grocery bags. Hm.
		Bags. Thrown away. A-ha! I've still got some empty bin bags. I put everything
		in one and I'm on my way.<br>
		<br>
		First, I go to Eccentric Bob's Overly Specific Everything Shop. It's the best
		place if you want to look like a weird villain. I get myself a black cape with
		the faces of a local cricket team, which I put on the wrong way round so it
		just looks black. I pair it with an acid spitting bowler hat and a utility belt
		to put my things in. To top it all off, I get a pack of self-lighting,
		completely black cigarettes. Pretty sure they're covered in tar.<br>
		<br>
		With the preparations done, I proceed towards my destination: The Bad
		Neighbourhood. Like a few other masked vigilantes, I don't really have
		superpowers, and I'm not rich enough for fancy gadgets. Only a fool or a madman
		would go after the big fish without being sure they can hit hard enough to win.
		Since I'm not one of the folks who can take down crime syndicates all on their
		own, I need help. That's why I've been taking it slowly, dealing with small
		fries first. I hope to work my way up to the big leagues, become the protector
		of Ipswich, its guardian angel. Except there's one problem: I can't climb the
		ranks of superheroism alone, but I also can't get the support I need without
		being noticed. In order to get this ball rolling, I need to do something really
		fucking risky and stupid.<br>
		<br>
		So that's what I'm about to do. I get to the edge of the bad neighbourhood.
		It's so easy to tell where it begins: All the buildings are damaged,
		everything's tagged, and there's a line of blood marking the border. It's not
		the most dangerous place in the world, far from it. I had a mate who went to
		Glasgow once. Indian guy, hadn't been to England yet at that point. It probably
		saved his life. The fuckers there can smell anything English from a mile away.
		He was hardly three hours there and I'm still surprised he survived that. He
		ran into a razor gang, though many had knives and claymores. I guess it's just
		easier to call them razor gangs than miscellaneous weapon gangs. He looked at
		them all weirded out cause they were snorting coke in public, though he later
		found out it was probably capsaicin or anthrax. Poor guy ran all the way to
		England before he lost them. Traumatised him quite a bit. So many nightmares. He
		heard them chanting &quot;Chib the wanker&quot; every night for the rest of his
		life. In the end, he got eaten by the mould, rest his soul.<br>
		<br>
		Whatever is in The Bad Neighbourhood, it can't be worse than that. I'll make a
		name for myself there yet. All of Ipswich will know who Dawnbringer is. I take
		a deep breath and step over the line.<br>

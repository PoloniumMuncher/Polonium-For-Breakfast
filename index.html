		<h1>Polonium for Breakfast</h1><hr/><br/>
			<p>
			Hello. Looks like you've stumbled upon Polonium for Breakfast. Hope you enjoy your stay.
			</p>
		<h2>Okay, what even is this?</h2>
			<p>
			It's a repository of fiction set in the universe of Polonium for Breakfast. It's meant to represent a style, a pseudo-genre of sorts. It's about rule of cool and treating absurdity as logical: chainsaw wielding ninja cowboys, monks snowboarding down a volcano, or evil terrorists building a giant laser in the Mariana Trench. Many works exist in this style: The Adventures of Dr. McNinja. Kung Fury, Iron Sky, Jesus Christ in the Name of the Gun... The list goes on. <br/><br/>However, outside the realm of fanfiction, very few of these works are literary ones. Polonium for Breakfast is here to help fill that niche. Written with the betterment of humanity in mind, it hopes to answer the many burning questions that have plagued mankind for millennia:<br/><br/>
			
			What if the incoherent rants of a conspiracy nut or the ramblings of a stoner made sense? What if adding spikes and fire to things were inherently practical? Can the pope skydive? Can a spaceship be held together by chewing gum? Where does the Sun go at night? What happens if you punch a god?<br/><br/>
			</p>
		
		<h2>Ah, so it's all about lolrandom humour!</h2>
			<p>
			Eeeeeh... Not quite. It's not just ridiculous nonsense happening all the time. There are some internal rules, a level of consistency. There is an actual story here, it's not just complete nonsense. Suddenly shouting "ha ha cheese!" isn't enough to drive a narrative or hold a setting together.<br/><br/>
			It's also not exactly supposed to be a comedy. While it's not a serious work by any stretch of the imagination, Polonium for Breakfast prioritises weirdness, originality, and the rule of cool over humour. The situations and concepts may seem comical to many, but actual jokes only appear in moderate frequency.
			</p>
		<h2>Wow, that's really fucking niche.</h2>
			<p>
			Yep.
			</p>
		<h2>Okay, but what's the setting?</h2>
			<p>
			It's a very small universe. There's an Earth, some familiar nations and names appear, but it's not an alternate timeline. At no point in time was it the same as real Earth, the universe itself is quite different, and a lot of the resemblance is superficial. Most celestial bodies are immobile, anchored in space. Planetoids are everywhere, planets all do their own thing, and moving black and white holes tear through the cosmos. More detailed info can be found in the information and visuals section.
			</p>
		<h2>Aaaaand... Where's the actual stuff?</h2>
			<p>
			Here! While minor spoilers are pretty much everywhere, anything that contains medium to major spoilers has spoiler warnings. Links that are grouped together are considered a series and individual links don't include warnings for previous chapters. The spoiler warnings from the first link of the series apply to the series as a whole. Furthermore, any links that spoil a series only warn about the first chapter of that series.<br/><br/>
			</p>
		<h3>Stories</h3>
			<p>
			Mostly regular narrative prose, some experimental formats, nothing too wild. It's mostly just text.<br/><br/>

			</p>
		<h2>So, who's behind all this, anyway?</h2>
			<p>
			Ah, I'm glad you asked. We're not ready to use our real names yet, and may never be, but the three people who end up reading this might want some way to refer to us.<br/><br/>
			
			This website and story are primarily the work of Vjeran BogunoviÄ‡, but it's not a solo project. Vjeran started writing bits and pieces set in this universe back in 2014 with the help of Hrvoje Horvat. While he hasn't written written anything directly, Hrvoje has been part of the brainstorming and decision making process since day one, and his thoughts and contributions have shaped the universe as a whole.<br/><br/>
			Polonium for Breakfast also incorporates minor ideas and suggestions from a man named John Tandrex Bucketface.<br/>

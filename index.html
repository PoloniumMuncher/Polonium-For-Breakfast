			<p>
			Hello. Looks like you've stumbled upon Polonium for Breakfast. Hope you enjoy your stay.
			</p>
		<h2>Okay, what even is this?</h2>
			<p>
			It's a repository of fiction set in the universe of Polonium for Breakfast, primarily stories and lore blurbs. Written with the betterment of humanity in mind, it hopes to answer the many burning questions that have plagued mankind for millennia:<br/><br/>
			
			What if the incoherent rants of a conspiracy nut or the ramblings of a stoner made sense? What if adding spikes and fire to things were inherently practical? Is chewing gum enough to hold a spaceship together? Where does the Sun go at night? What happens if you punch a god?<br/><br/>
			</p>
		
		<h2>Ah, so it's a site for lolrandom humour!</h2>
			<p>
			Eeeeeh... Not quite. There are some internal rules, a level of consistency. Suddenly shouting "ha ha cheese!" isn't enough to drive a narrative or hold a setting together.<br/><br/>
			It's also not exactly supposed to be a comedy. While it's not a serious work by any stretch of the imagination, Polonium for Breakfast prioritises unusual ideas and the rule of cool over humour. The situations and concepts themselves may seem comical, but actual jokes only appear in moderate frequency.
			</p>
		<h2>Wow, that's really fucking niche.</h2>
			<p>
			Yep.
			</p>
		<h2>Aaaaand... Where's the actual stuff?</h2>
			<p>
			Here! While minor spoilers are pretty much everywhere, anything that contains medium to major spoilers has spoiler warnings. Links that are grouped together are considered a series and individual links don't include warnings for previous chapters. The spoiler warnings from the first link of the series apply to the series as a whole. Any links that spoil a series only warn about the first chapter of that series.<br/><br/>
			</p>
		<h3>Stories</h3>
			<p>
			Mostly regular narrative prose, some experimental formats, nothing too wild. It's mostly just text.<br/><br/>

		<h2>So, who's behind all this, anyway?</h2>
			<p>
			Ah, I'm glad you asked. We're not ready to use our real names yet, and may never be, but the three people who end up reading this might want some way to refer to us.<br/><br/>
			
			This website and story are primarily the work of Vjeran BogunoviÄ‡, but it's not a solo project. Vjeran started writing bits and pieces set in this universe back in 2014 with the help of Hrvoje Horvat. While he hasn't written written anything directly, Hrvoje has been part of the brainstorming and decision making process since day one, and his thoughts and contributions have shaped the universe as a whole.<br/><br/>
			
			Polonium for Breakfast also incorporates minor ideas and suggestions from a man named John Tandrex Bucketface.<br/><br/>
			Overloaded from Athens and Joe from Ipswich have also provided some information about their home cities, letting me create alt-Earth mockeries of real places with a bit more knowledge of what I'm butchering. The Greek characters not having ridiculous names can also be blamed on Overloaded.<br/><br/>
			Though I can't list everyone who has read my works and provided feedback, it's important that I at least acknowledge them. Feedback is essential, and I'm thankful to everyone who has provided it.<br/><br/>
			As for everyone else who has read any of the works on this site, thanks for giving them a try. Hope you enjoyed them.<br/>

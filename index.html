			<p>
			Hello. Looks like you've stumbled upon Polonium for Breakfast. Hope you enjoy your stay.
			</p>
		<h2>Okay, what even is this?</h2>
			<p>
			It's a repository of fiction set in the universe of Polonium for Breakfast, primarily lore blurbs and stories, though I guess I might also use some other formats one day.<br/><br/>
			<br/><br/>
			</p>
		<h2>Mind to elaborate?</h2>
			<p>
			Uh, sure. It's crack fic setting. But not fanfic. Like, idk, fucking McNinja (which you should totally read) or whatever.<br/><br/>
			</p>		
		<h2>Okay, enough introduction, where's the actual stuff?</h2>
			<p>
			Here! While minor spoilers are pretty much everywhere due to the work being interconnected, any link that contains medium to major spoilers has a spoiler warnings indicating which other link it spoils. Links that are grouped together indicate what isn't necessarily a series, but it is a set of closely related stories.<br/><br/>
			</p>
		<h3>Stories</h3>
			<p>
			Mostly regular narrative prose, some experimental formats, nothing too wild. It's mostly just text.<br/><br/>

			<a href="HotBronzeAndQuickPrayersIndex.html">Hot Bronze and Quick Prayers</a> (Unfinished, on hold)<br/>
			<br/>
			</p>
		<h3>Information and visuals</h3>
			<p>
			Lore blurbs, schematics, drawings, anything from worldbuilding to character bios. As long as it's more focused on information than storytelling, it goes here. Lots of text, some images.<br/><br/>
					
			<!--<a href="" style="color:pink;">Test Lore Blurb Link (Layout test link, will be nuked later)</a><br/><br/>
			<a href="" style="color:pink;">Test Random Crap (Layout test link, will be nuked later)</a><br/><br/>
			<a href="" style="color:pink;">Absolute Nonsense (Layout test link, will be nuked later)</a><br/><br/>-->
			</p>
		<h3>Other media</h3>
			<p>
			This is reserved for anything that doesn't fit in the previous categories, like interactive stories or whatever. It's likely to stay empty for a while, if not forever.<br/><br/>
			
			</p>
		<h2>So, who's behind all this, anyway?</h2>
			<p>
			Ah, I'm glad you asked. We're not ready to use our real names yet, and may never be, but the three people who end up reading this might want to have some way to refer to us.<br/><br/>
			
			I'm Vjeran BogunoviÄ‡. This website are primarily my work, though it's not entirely a solo project.<br/><br/>
			I started writing bits and pieces set in this universe back in 2014 with the help of Hrvoje Horvat. While he hasn't written written anything directly, he has provided some suggestions and a number of illustrations, and a few of his ideas still exist in the setting. He is the mind behind the  He isn't particularly involved nowadays, but he helped add a bit of spice to the setting early on.<br/><br/>
			
			Polonium for Breakfast also incorporates minor ideas and suggestions from a man who will be referred to as John Tandrex Bucketface, such as the IDK&amp;IDC store chain and some uses for superpowers.<br/><br/>
			Overloaded from Athens and Joe from Ipswich have also provided some information about their home cities, letting me create alt-Earth mockeries of real places with a tiny bit more knowledge of what real life locations I'm butchering. Overloaded also double checked the Greek names to make sure they're not absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>
			Though I don't have a full list of everyone who has read my works and provided feedback, it's important that I at least acknowledge them. Feedback is essential, and I'm thankful to everyone who has provided it.<br/><br/>
			As for everyone else who has read any of the works on this site, thanks for giving Polonium for Breakfast a try. Hope you enjoyed it.<br/>

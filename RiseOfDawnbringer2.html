		<i>Chapter 2</i>
		<br/><br/>
		So, this is The Bad Neighbourhood. I really feel like I have a much better
		understanding of it now that I've made a single step over an arbitrary border. Everything
		looks... Uh... Exactly the same as it did one step ago. But now that I'm
		technically on the other side, it also feels more dangerous, more sinister. I'm
		one step away from perfect safety. The moment I crossed that godsforsaken line,
		it felt like I triggered a tripwire. A cheap booby trap made of an empty can of
		beans and fertiliser will surely blow my legs off now. There's barely anyone
		here, but I feel like everyone's eyes are on me. As if I shouted &quot;26 + 6 =
		1&quot; in the House of Commons or something. Not that I know what that feels like.<br/>
		<br/>
		But I've come this far. No point turning back now. I take another step. Then
		another. And another. With each step I walk deeper into this horrifying place. It's
		terrible, but I don't stop. This is the only way. My hopes and dreams lie
		ahead, and they look suspiciously like dilapidated buildings and piss stained
		corners. It feels like I'm wading through a sea of cigarette butts. The ground
		is covered in puke, blood, and discarded needles. Nightmares are still dreams,
		right?<br/>
		<br/>
		The locals seem particularly fond of corners. Figures. They keep reminding me
		that I'm in the wrong neighbourhood. Because I don't know that, right? Morons.
		I suppose it means my costume isn't that convincing, though. I light one of the
		cigs to make myself look more menacing.<br/>
		<br/>
		Gods know how many casinos and brothels I pass before I get to some seedy
		looking pub. The armed guards at the entrance really scream &quot;reputable
		establishment&quot;. I rattle off a few prayers to the excuses for my gods and
		enter.<br/>
		<br/>
		I can't see my hand in front of my face through the thick tobacco smoke, and
		the dim lighting doesn't help. They probably think it hides the cokroaches. It
		doesn't. There's a mutant spider fighting ring because of course there is. I
		see folks getting stabbed left and right, hopefully for a good reason. I'd hate
		to lose my spleen because I looked at someone wrong. I'm just here to watch for
		now.<br/>
		<br/>
		I take a seat and enjoy the wonderful lack of a view. It's hard to go
		undisturbed in a place like this, though. I'm told to order something or leave.
		They've got all sorts of drinks, from beer to antifreeze and motor oil, but I
		don't drink on the job. Thankfully, they still sell coke, so I order that. They
		make me pay upfront, the paranoid bastards. I try to start a conversation with
		the not so slightly shitfaced guy sitting next to me.<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;'Scuse me&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;The ffffuck do you wwwwwant?&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;I was wondering if you could tell me where I could buy a spleen and-&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;Are you a fucking... A ffff... fffffucking... Cop or some shhhhit?&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;No, I was just-&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;Ffffuck off&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;I can pay if-&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;I sssaid FFFUCK OFF!&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		Well, that was productive. I look around to see if anyone looks talkative.
		Almost everyone's armed, and I'm getting some mean looks. Maybe asking gangsters
		a lot of questions isn't the best approach for people with a sense of self
		preservation. I doubt Ouchara, Goddess of Stubbed Toes will do much to protect
		me if I piss someone off. I think I'll be fine without answers from people who
		might shoot me later. I can find stuff myself. <br/>
		<br/>
		I leave the pub, my coke still unsnorted. There's still a worrying number of
		eyes on me. It's like they can sense I don't belong here. I've got to find a
		way to fit in better. Perhaps if I cackle? That's evil, right? Eh, maybe later.
		For now, I think I'll just explore this place and hope I don't get murdered.
		This is going so much worse than planned. I really should have thought it
		through better. But whatever. You live (hopefully) and you learn. <br/>
		<br/>
		There's a lot of traffic going in and out of some large building. Looks
		promising. I can't quite make out what the sign says through the trees, so I
		get a bit closer and A-HA! Bingo! Just what I was looking for. The Black
		Supermarket. There are no guards here, but there are probably some on the inside.
		I say my prayers and enter.<br/>
		<br/>
		It's surprisingly clean inside. It would feel a bit like a regular supermarket
		if it didn't use blacklight for the lighting. As it is, it looks like a weird
		combination of a supermarket and a night club. It's surprisingly clean and
		really well supplied. They sell all sorts of goods, from guns to depleted uranium.
		And oh, black tar heroin is on sale. Black... Tar... Hm. That raises some
		questions about the contents of my cigarettes, but whatever. I go to the
		freezer section and find all sorts of exotic meats there. I'm pretty sure half
		of those animals are endangered. There are also some human organs. It doesn't
		say on the packaging who the supplier is, though. Maybe it's for the better,
		they're probably too dangerous for me to handle at this point.<br/>
		<br/>
		Gods, there's even a small bakery at the back. They sell perfectly normal looking
		bread and pot brownies. I bet the bread has razors or poison in it. Nothing
		here can be that innocent. A lot of the items in this place actually have proper
		packaging with fancy designs and text on the back. Too bad it's really hard to
		read under this light, and none of it lists the supplier or anything useful. It's
		another dead end. Getting info about criminals isn't easy, who'd have thought?
		Maybe I could ask one of the cashiers if they know anything. As I approach them
		I notice they have snacks and sweets next to the cash register, just like in a
		regular superma- Aaaaaaand it's all drugs. Because of course it is. You know
		what, fuck this place, I'm sick of this shit, I'm going home.<br/>
		<br/>
		On my way back, I notice some dealers I could possibly take out. 
		Just shoot them and be done with it. It's also a really reliable way to get myself killed. 
		This won't be easy. I need a good target, and I need a plan of attack. I'm not sure how
		I'm supposed to get anything done without fancy gear or superpowers, but there's
		no way I'm giving up.<br/>
		<br/>
		As gods are my witnesses, I will become the hero of Ipswich.<br/>

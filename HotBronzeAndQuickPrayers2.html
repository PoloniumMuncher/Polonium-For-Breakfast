		<i>Chapter 2</i>
		<br/><br/>
		So, this is The Bad Neighbourhood. I really feel like I have a much better
		understanding of it now that I've made a single step over some arbitrary
		border. Everything looks... Uh... Exactly the same as it did one step ago. But
		now that I'm technically on the other side, it also feels more dangerous, more
		sinister. I'm one step away from perfect safety. The moment I crossed that
		godsforsaken line, I triggered a metaphorical tripwire. A cheap booby trap made
		of an empty can of beans will surely blow my legs off now. There's barely
		anyone here, but there are still too many eyes are on me, like I'm an
		optician's poorly thought out mascot.<br>
		<br>
		But I've come this far. No point turning back now. I take another step. Then
		another. And another. With each step, I walk deeper into this horrifying place.
		It's terrible, but I don't stop. This is the only way. My hopes and dreams lie
		ahead, and they look suspiciously like dilapidated buildings and piss stained
		everything. I'm practically wading through a sea of cigarette butts and
		discarded needles.<br>
		<br>
		The locals seem particularly fond of corners. Figures. They keep reminding me
		that I'm in the wrong neighbourhood. Very thoughtful of them. I suppose that
		means my costume isn't all that convincing. I light one of the cigs and scowl
		to make myself look more menacing.<br>
		<br>
		Gods know how many casinos and brothels I pass before I get to some seedy
		looking pub. The armed guards at the entrance really scream &quot;reputable
		establishment&quot;. I rattle off a few prayers to what can only very
		generously be described as gods, grunt at the guards, and enter.<br>
		<br>
		I can't see my hand in front of my face through the thick tobacco smoke, and
		the dim lighting doesn't help. They probably think it hides the cokroaches. It
		doesn't. There's a mutant spider fighting ring - because of course there is. I also
		see folks getting stabbed left and right, hopefully for a good reason. I'd hate
		to lose my spleen because I looked at someone the wrong way. I'm just here to
		watch for now, learn about this place.<br>
		<br>
		I take a seat and enjoy the wonderful non-view. I don't get to relax in the cosy
		atmosphere for long, though. I'm told to order something or leave. They've got
		all sorts of drinks, from beer to antifreeze and motor oil, but I don't drink
		on the &quot;job&quot;. Thankfully, they still sell coke, so I order that. They
		make me pay upfront, the paranoid bastards.<br>
		<br>
		Â I try to start a conversation with the not-so-slightly shitfaced guy sitting
		next to me. He accuses me of being a cop when I start asking questions and tells
		me to fuck off. A very productive conversation, that. I look around to see if there's
		anyone else who looks like they might be talkative. Almost everyone's armed,
		and I'm getting some mean looks. Maybe asking potential gangsters for
		information isn't all that smart. I doubt Liem Para, Goddess of Stubbed Toes,
		will do much to protect me if I piss someone off. I think I'll just find stuff
		out some other way. <br>
		<br>
		I leave the pub, my coke unsnorted. There's still a worrying number of eyes on
		me. Guess they can sense I don't belong here. I've got to find a way to fit in
		better. Perhaps if I cackle? That's evil, right? <br>
		<br>
		Eh, maybe later. For now, I think I'll just explore this place and hope I don't
		get murdered. This is going so much worse than planned. I really should have
		thought this through. But whatever. You live and you learn. <br>
		<br>
		There's a lot of traffic going in and out of some large building. Looks
		promising. I can't quite make out what the sign says through the trees, so I
		get a bit closer aaaand... A-HA! Bingo! Just what I was looking for. The Black
		Supermarket. There are no guards at the door, but I doubt there's no security
		at all. I say my prayers again and enter.<br>
		<br>
		It's surprisingly clean inside. It would look like a regular supermarket if it
		weren't lit like a nightclub. The shelves are fully stocked. They sell all
		sorts of goods, from guns to depleted uranium. And oh, black tar heroin is on
		sale. Hm. Black. Tar. That raises some questions about the contents of my
		cigarettes, but whatever. I go to the freezer section and find all sorts of
		exotic meats there. I'm pretty sure half of those are from endangered animals. There
		are also some human organs. I really wish I knew where they got those, but
		maybe it's for better that I don't. Whoever's responsible is probably too
		dangerous for me at this point.<br>
		<br>
		The place is huge. Gods, there's even a small bakery at the back. They sell
		perfectly normal looking bread and pot brownies. I don't trust that. I bet the
		bread has razors or poison in it. Nothing here can be that innocent. A lot of
		the items in this place actually have proper packaging with fancy designs and
		text on the back. Too bad it's hard to read under this light, and it never
		lists the supplier or anything useful. It's another dead end as far as
		information goes. Learning about criminals isn't easy, who'd have thought?
		Maybe I could ask one of the cashiers if they know anything. As I approach them,
		I notice they have snacks and sweets next to the cash register, just like in a
		regular superma- Aaaaaaand they're all drugs. Because of course they are. You
		know what? Fuck this place, I'm sick of this shit, I'm going home. The hero of
		Ipswich needs a break and a new plan.<br/>
